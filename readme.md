This is very old code from past decade! Last i worked on it was in 2012ish.
Use at your risk!

These are collection of my visual programming / low code experiments. This is a web app run as server and connect from
your local browser!

This is supposed to be used only on local or loop back adapter as it basically runs with same privilages as your user account so 
super risky to make it accessable beyond your local machine.

Once you have build your visual experiment or graph it can deployed to run in more secured way or as job, examples
are there i will put up more examples!

Enjoy

I use explicitly eclipse and you can find launch file in root of project.

To acces run code and access through your google chrome at :
